        <h1>5 Reasons to Learn Python Programming Language:</h1>
        <p>The Python programming language is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Python has a simple
            easy to use syntax which makes it a perfect language for someone who is trying to learn to programme for the
            first time. However, if you are someone who already knows other programming languages then Python can be
            really easy to learn and it has a lot of other benefits as well. </p>

        <h3>Here we present you 5 Reasons to Learn Python Programming Language:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Easy to Learn:</h3>
                <p>Python programming language is one of the easiest languages to learn. Python uses clean and simple
                    syntax which allows newbies to learn the language easily. Python is readable and you can easily
                    understand the code by looking at it. Python is known for its simplicity and the wide range of
                    libraries. Once you've learnt the syntax and the resources offered by the Python library. You are
                    ready to start coding.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Web Application Development:</h3>
                <p>Python has been a very successful language in web applications and Internet development. Python
                    offers a wide range of frameworks like Django, CherryPy, Flask etc, which provides you with
                    extensive libraries and modules which makes the work easier. Python helps you in speeding up the
                    various processes including database access, content management, error tracking, data Authorization
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>The compatibility of Python with multiple systems and platforms makes it the most popular and
                    demanding programming language in application development.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Multiple Programming Paradigms:</h3>
                <p>When it comes to supporting a number of programming paradigms, Python has the upper hand. It supports
                    multiple Programming Paradigms like object-oriented programming, functional programming, structured
                    programming and empirical programming. Python allows you to develop both small scale applications as
                    well as high-level complex applications.</p>
                <p>Python has a dynamic nature which can be used to develop games, web applications, multi-software and
                    much more. It also offers automatic memory management which manages and deals with several dynamic
                    storage management.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Data Extraction:</h3>
                <p>Data Extraction is the process to retrieve data from different sources on the web and organize them
                    into valuable ones. This beautiful feature is also a good reason to learn Python as it makes work a
                    lot easier. The web scraping tools and frameworks of Python can efficiently retrieve data from the
                    web pages.</p>
                <p>Python has a robust standard library which provides highly functional tools which not works for data
                    extraction but also helps in other various tasks. The web scrapers are also helpful in data
                    retrieval, machine learning, SEO and much more.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science:</h3>
                <p>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are the most grossing industries and Python is the language
                    which is being used to conduct further studies and research. For someone who's interested in the
                    field of artificial intelligence and data science, Python is a must.</p>
                <p>Python data visualisation tools allow you to present big data and analytics easily. Python offers a
                    bunch of tools to create interactive graphical plots and data graph. Some of the most used tools are
                    Panda, Bokeh, Pygal and Seaborn.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're planning to learn Python then you should start learning it right away. It has a very high demand in
