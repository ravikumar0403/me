        <h1>Motion in 1 dimension</h1>
        <p>You may think that why do we need to study one dimensional situation while the world we live in is three dimensional. All the problems based on translational motion can be divided into a one-dimensional problem. This makes it easier to solve the problems and various physics problems are analysed by this approach. Complex problems are often reduced to simpler problems.</p>

        <p>Setting up a coordinate system by defining the starting point i.e. the origin along with the positive and negative directions, is the first step in solving a problem. Distinguishing between the scalar and vectors is also needed. Any quantity that has the only magnitude is known as a scalar quantity. Area and temperature are examples of scalar. A vector quantity has both magnitudes as well as direction like velocity or displacement.</p>

        <p>There are four basic parameters that must be considered while analysing the motion of objects. Time, displacement, velocity and acceleration are the basic parameters. Among these four parameters, all are vector except for time which is a scalar quantity. In one dimension, it's not easy to note the difference between scalar and vector but in two dimensions, the difference is obvious.</p>

        <h3>Displacement</h3>
        <p>Displacement is a vector quantity, it represents the amount of distance travelled along with the direction. When you travel from one place to another place that is 5 meters in the east direction then the displacement is 5 m east and distance travelled is 5 m. Now when the person travels to 5 meters in the west direction the total displacement will be 0 and distance travelled will be 10 m. Displacement is calculated by the difference between the final position (x) and the initial position (xo)</p>
            
        <h3>Speed and Velocity:</h3>
        <p>Imagine that you are going to class at a speed of 3m/s east. You have left your home on time but after one minute, you realize that you have not taken your physics assignment with you so you need to return back home to take your assignment. You run back to home at 6m/s to take your assignment. Since you are now running at double the speed you were going to school, it takes half the time (30 seconds) to reach back home.</p>

        <p>The time period of 90 seconds you have taken when you started from home and reached back can be analysed in several ways. You can calculate the average speed which is defined by the ratio of total distance covered by the total time taken. When you were walking to class at 3 m/s for a minute, the distance covered is 180 meters. But the same distance is covered in 30 seconds while you were returning home. Therefore, the total distance travelled by you is 360 meters in a time period of 90 seconds.</p>

        <p>The equation for average speed is given by </p>
            <code>Average speed=distance travelled/total time = 360/90 = 4 m/s.</code>
            
        <p>The equation for average velocity is given by </p>
            <pre>Average Velocity = Displacement/time</pre>
        
        <p>In the above example, the distance travelled by you is 360 m/s but the displacement is zero because you reached the same position where you started. Since the displacement is zero, the average velocity is also zero.</p>
        
        <p>Speed and velocity are often considered in terms of instantaneous speed and instantaneous velocity. Instantaneous speed tells us how fast an object is moving whereas instantaneous velocity gives us the direction as well. The rate of change of position of an object with respect to time is but for a small interval of time, is defined as instantaneous velocity. Consider a short period of time  ∆t and the displacement in ∆t is ∆x then the instantaneous velocity is given by 
            <code>V = ∆t/∆x</code>
        The instantaneous speed of an object is simply the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the object.</p>    
           
        
        <h3>Acceleration</h3>
        <p>Whenever the velocity of an object changes, the object is said to be accelerated. Consider the example we used earlier. But this time, you don't run. Instead, you are walking back and steadily increasing your velocity to reach from 3m/s to 6m/s. The time taken for this change to happen is 10 second. Assume that your speed increased at a constant rate which means you experienced a constant acceleration of 0.3 m/s².</p>
        
        <p>Since the acceleration is constant, the average velocity is given by the ratio of initial velocity and final velocity.</p>
